# Adapative Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI)

### Reduced user's active analysis time, per image, by a factor of ~75, drastically reducing labor costs

### Data fitted dynamically and automatically using a custom iterative categorization and regression technique

### Weighting and bias-of-fit calculated according to uncertainties from measurements stored in file meta-data

### Classification of 'fitting zones' (linear v. exponential) by $Adjusted-R^2$ comparison between multiple fitting attempts

### Ultimate calculation was of fractal dimension, saturation roughness, and correlation length for ultra-fine images

### Written using MATLAB, an ideal tool for linear algebra and statistics over large matrices
